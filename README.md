# It's a work in progress..

## Why the name Frognet though?
If you search for a the phrase "Eat that frog" then Google will return you the following text: "Eating the frog is the process of identifying your most difficult task of the day and completing it before you do any other work". I just wanted to use build a tool which can catch the frogs for me.

## Demo
Currently it works using postman.
